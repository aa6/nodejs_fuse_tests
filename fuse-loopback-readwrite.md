`fuse-loopback-readwrite` is a moderate-featured loopback filesystem implementation for a Node.js `fuse-bindings` package. It consists of 20 functions. The functions are not binded upon mounting into some class instance and `this` by default points to a higher context, usually to `global`.

### init(cb)
Called on filesystem initialization, prior to all other functions. Called only one time per each mount. Always accepts only one input argument.

**Parameters:**  
`cb` Callback to call after the function done it's work.
