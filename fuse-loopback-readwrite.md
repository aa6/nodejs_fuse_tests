[`fuse-loopback-readwrite`](/fuse-loopback-readwrite.coffee) is a moderate-featured loopback filesystem linux-only implementation for a Node.js [`fuse-bindings`](https://github.com/mafintosh/fuse-bindings) package. It consists of 20 functions. The functions are not binded upon mounting into some class instance and `this` by default points to a higher context, usually to `global`.

### init(cb)
Called on filesystem initialization, prior to all other functions. Called only one time per each mount. Always accepts only one input argument.

**Parameters:**  
`cb` Callback to call after the function done it's work.

**Return:**  
Init doesn't return any values and would NOT raise any errors or exceptions if you'll pass an error code to the `cb` as an argument.

### readdir(path, cb)
Called when a directory is being listed. Readdir is not called if the `path` entry wasn't listed by parent directory readdir call (if the entry doesn't exists). Always accepts only two input arguments.

**Parameters:**  
`path` Path to a file within the FUSE filesystem. Path is always starts with a directory separator (slash).  
`cb` Callback to call after the function done it's work.

**Return:**  
Returns values by `cb(error_code, entries_array)` callback. `entries_array` is a list of files and directories which requested `path` contains.
